# Talks with Lester
There's three parts that you think you are 
这三个部分是你认为自己所是的
You are that's your beingness that's the real part of you
你是你的存在 这部分是真正的你
Which sets up your mind and then develops all these programs over the ages 
它建立了你的心智，然后在这些岁月里发展出来这些程序，
and the programs motivate the thinking and the programs are your feelings
这些程序驱动了思考，这些程序就是你的感觉
Feelings are simply programs subconscious automated programs of how we react to the external world 
但感觉只是一种程序，一种潜意识的自动化程序，反映了我们对外部世界的反应
And every one of them has been put in as a pro-survival program in order to keep the body surviving 
每一个感受被写进来，都是为了让身体存活下来
You'll get to see how silly it is when you're trying to survive a situation that you are eternal in 
你会发现，尝试在本就永恒的状态下生存是如此的愚蠢
And that's what you're doing you've got no choice you're eternal
这就是你在做的，你别无选择，你就是永恒的
So in your beingness you create your mind and start programming everything and you think you are the body and you think the world is external to you所以在你的存在状态，你创造的心智，并开始对所有事编程，你认为你是身体，你认为世界是外在的
after you have created it you let go of remembering that you created this whole thing it's all created here in your mind 
在创造完了之后，你忘记了这一切都是你创造的，都是在你的心智中创造出来的
Change the picture mentally and instantly changes out there called the miracle
在心智层面改变画面，就能立刻改变外面的世界，这叫奇迹
But there's nothing out there but the sum total thinking-ness 
外面什么都没有，只是你思想的总和
most of which is subconscious and therein lies the problem 
其中大部分是潜意识的，这就是问题所在
subconscious means simply we do not want to look at it 
潜意识仅仅意味着我们不想看它
the mind is a tremendous mystery to the world because they don't understand what it is
心智对世界来说是一个巨大的迷，因为他们不知道它是什么
they can't see the simplicity of it it's the some total of all your feelings and thoughts
他们看不出它的简单性，它是你所有的感觉和想法的总和
that's all how simple it is it's a collection of your feelings and thoughts 
就是这么简单，你的感觉和想法的集合
and everything you experience is via the mind go unconscious the mind's out of the way there's no experiencing
你所经历的一切都是通过心智，失去意识，当没有心智，也就没有经历了
but you can make it otherwise you continue in what you're doing but shift your identity from being the body just a being 
但你也可以换一种方式，你继续做你正在做的事情，但是转换你的认同，把对身体的认同变成对存在的认同
identifying with your beingness and you just sit back and you watch the world go by 
去认同你的存在，而你只是坐着看世界运转
you get into the state of witnessing you don't even feel yourself moving
你进入了一种见证的状态，你甚至感觉不到自己在移动
because you cannot you're omnipresent when you identify with your beingness 
因为你不能，你所全在的，当你跟你的存在认同
you discover that you're everywhere present the entire universe 
你会发现你在整个宇宙中都是全在的
and should you choose you can take a look see anywhere in the universe without moving 
你可以在不移动的情况下看一看宇宙中的任何地方
because you're there you don't don't even have to do astral travel your omnipresence 
因为你就在那里，你甚至不需要星光体旅行，你是全在的
astral travel is in the mind astral body mind are almost one in the same thing
星光体旅行是在心智中发生，星光体和心智，差不多是同一回事
so identify where you're at make a decision to cut the journey short go free why agony when you can be free 
所以认出你现在的位置，做个决定，缩短旅程，获得自由，既然你可以自由，还有什么好痛苦的？
so the real you is the beingness the ego you is two and three your mind and your body 
所以真正的你是存在，自我是这白板上的第2行和第3行，心智和身体
and the three states that you identify with are beingness doingness and happiness 
你认同的三种状态是：1.存在  2.行动  3.拥有
and with this you can relate to the chart of emotions after the apathy grief fear are down in happiness only 
有了这个，你可以跟情绪表联系起来，万念俱灰、悲苦、恐惧，是底部的拥有的状态
when you're down there you think your welfare your wherewithal depends on how much you can have and you spend all your time trying to make and have 
当你那么低的时候，你觉得你的幸福取决于你能拥有多少，你把所有的时间都花在让自己拥有上
you move up into lust anger pride courageousness you move into it doing this instead of thinking your welfare lies in having you feel you got to be a of doer 
当你上升到 贪求、愤怒、自尊自傲和无畏，是上升到了行动的状态，不再认为你的幸福取决于你拥有什么，你觉得你要成为一个“做者”
that's an advanced state only five percent of us are doers 95 of us are wanting to have 
当然这是一种高级点的状态了，我们中只有5%的人是做者，而95%的人想要拥有
we're down so low we put ourselves in a in the state of being a slave we must have a job someone must tell us what to do and give us the food that we eat and the money to get our lodgings 
我们是如此的卑微以至于把自己置于奴隶的状态，我们必须有一份工作，必须有人告诉我们做什么，给我们提供食物和住宿的钱
the only reason why people work in jobs is that we have a slave consciousness we're down in a happiness apathy grief and fear that's where most people are writing the majority of times
人们工作的唯一原因是我们有奴隶意识，我们在底下的“拥有”状态，万念俱灰、悲苦、恐惧，这是大多数人大部分时间所处的位置
move up into courageousness pride anger and lust then you get to be a doer which is a much freer state than being a slave 
上升到无畏、自尊自傲、愤怒和贪求，然后你就成了做者，这是一个跟奴隶相比相对自由点的状态，
and when you get into the state of I can do you've got enough wish and will to move to the top 
当你到了那个“我能做到”的状态时，你有足够的愿望和意志去到顶端
because you discover when you're just quiet and being that's the nicest thing there is 
因为你会发现当你静下来只是存在，那就是最好的事情了
and with the doing this energy you'll work harder to drop the remaining limitations the AGFLAP so that you can remain and just to be all the time 
处于“行动”状态的能量，你更努力的去丢掉剩下的限制 丢掉AGFLAP(万念俱灰/悲苦/恐惧/贪求/愤怒/自尊自傲)，这样你就可以一直保持存在的状态，
now that sense of beingness is not related to the world it relates to how you look at the world 
这种存在的感觉，与世界无关，而与你如何看待世界有关
you watch the world go by you watch yourself you watch your own body moving around like you now watch other bodies
你看着世界流逝，你看着你自己，你看着自己的身体移动
you'll see your body objective to you like you see other bodies objective to you
你会看到你的身体对你来说也是客观的了，就像你看别的身体是客观的那样
16.13
so try to move up to constantly identifying with your beingness 
所以试着不断地认同你的存在
hold I am or I I I only 
持住这个“我是” 或者 只是 我 我 我
I am my beingness I am I am I amness 
我是我的存在 我是 我是我所是
And when you get to be the doer then try to see that you're not the doer that all that is objective to you 
当你能成为一个做者，试着看到你不是做者，看到一切对你都是客观的
try to take the attitude I am not the doer 
试着采取我不是“做者”的态度
and what happens there is you let go of the ego sense of doing 
会发生什么呢？你放开了那个做者的自我感
and shift into allowing the higher power or whatever you call it to do it 
转而让更高的能力，或随便你叫它什么吧，让它去做
in religion they say , let go , let god .Can he do it ? He can do everything 
在宗教中，他们说，放手吧，让上帝来做。他能做到吗？他可以做到一切。
when you let go of your ego sense you automatically move into your beingness and that takes care of everything with no effort 
当你放下你的自我感，你会自动的移动到你的存在状态，那会毫不费力的照顾好一切。
and your life becomes totally effortless 
你的生活会变得完全无需费力
and start from taking all your happiness from you, recognize that every joy you have ,that nice quiet place of just being where your desires are out of the way 
从内在得到的所有的幸福开始，认识到你所拥有的每一种快乐，那种美好、安静的地方，只是你的存在，是你的欲望没有挡道的时候
even though you're taking pleasure from the world
即使你是从这个世界得到快乐
try to recognize that that pleasure is you being you your mind is quiet 
试着去认出你的快乐只是你在成为你，你的心智是安静的
now on the way we should identify with everyone as being us 
在这个过程中，我们应该把每个人视为我们自己
see everyone as you and that's what happens when you see that you are beingness and that your beingness is all beingness so it includes everyone 
把每个人视为你自己，当你认识到你就是存在时这就会发生，你的存在就是所有的存在，所以它包含了每一个人
so you see other people as you then try to identify with everything out there every atom as you because it's your making 
所以你把别人看成你，然后试着将外面的一切，每一个原子认成是你，因为这是你创造的
and when you identify with it you'll get to see that you created everything 
当你这样认同，你会发现你创造了你经历的一切
